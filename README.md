# sfg-nejm-sprint

## Setup
Download the `sprint_pop.zip` into the root of this folder. On OSX/Linux, run `unzip sprint_pop.zip` to create the data directory. I've already added all the files to the gitignore, so you won't accidentally add them to the repository. However, if we all do this the same way, we can share code relative to the project root directory and everything will work ok.
